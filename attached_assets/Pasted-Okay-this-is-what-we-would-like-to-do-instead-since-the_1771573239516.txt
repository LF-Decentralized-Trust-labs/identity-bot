Okay this is what we would like to do instead since there are you know constraints that we've just discussed. So we would like to or I would like to remind you though that I need you to look at the existing code base to analyze it because it already has a fully functional backend and front end that run on the same device so once you analyze the current code base then you will see what I'm talking about. So but I'd like you to do is find out what we need to add to the existing code to update it so it accomplishes what our goal is that is described above in your response as well as further clarified in the attached messages thanks I look forward to seeing your plan.

Instruction to consider strongly from my other AI agent: "Great catch on the Replit constraints. You are exactly right—we cannot build a true Zero-Trust Sandbox without root, iptables, and containerization.

Because of this, I do not want to build a fake simulation using HTTP_PROXY environment variables. That defeats the purpose of the security model, as a rogue app can just ignore the environment variables.

New Architecture Plan:
We are going to split the stack. This Replit project will solely be the Control Plane (The App Store UI and the Management API). I will build the actual Execution Engine (the Docker containers and iptables proxy) separately on a raw Ubuntu VPS.

For Milestone 1 on Replit, please do the following:

Build the Go backend API. It should have endpoints to register a new app, define a governance policy for it, and trigger a 'launch' command. (For now, the 'launch' command can just print a log statement; later it will send a webhook to my external VPS).

Build the App Store UI (Frontend Dashboard). I want a UI where I can see a list of 'Installed Apps', view their current status (Running/Stopped), and view a mock 'Audit Log' feed where we will eventually pipe in the intercepted network/system events from the VPS.

Keep the Go backend and frontend in this same Replit service for simplicity right now.

Please confirm you understand the split architecture and begin building the Go API and Frontend Dashboard.""

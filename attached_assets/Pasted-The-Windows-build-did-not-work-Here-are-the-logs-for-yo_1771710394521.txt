I can see the issue. This is a Codemagic CI build for the Flutter Windows app, and it's failing because after Chocolatey installs Go, the PATH isn't refreshed in the current PowerShell session — so go version can't find the go command.

Let me look at the build scripts to fix this:

I can see the problem clearly. The Windows build fails at the "Install Go toolchain" step because refreshenv doesn't work in the Codemagic PowerShell context — the Go binary isn't on the PATH after Chocolatey installs it. The fix is to manually set the Go PATH instead of relying on refreshenv.

The fix is straightforward. Here's what was wrong and what I changed:

The problem: On Codemagic's Windows builder, when Chocolatey installs Go, it updates the system PATH. But refreshenv doesn't work in PowerShell on Codemagic (the error message even says so in your logs: "RefreshEnv.cmd does not work when run from this process"). So when the script tries go version, it can't find the go binary.

The fix: Instead of relying on refreshenv, I explicitly add Go's install directory (C:\Program Files\Go\bin) to the PATH using PowerShell's $env:Path. I also added the same PATH line to the "Build Go backend" step, since each Codemagic script step runs in a fresh shell session.

The change is in codemagic.yaml — push it to your container-apps branch and re-run the build. It should get past the Go installation step and proceed to building the backend and Flutter app.
